How we did it:

1. Created a class of game which had two arguments of player 1 and player 2
2. Said that each player would have a name, amount of money and a position
3. Created a test file and checked that a player would start with £200 and start at position 0 - first two tests.
4. Created a test to check we can move a player, and created the corresponding move_player method.
5. Created a test to check we can change between players and made the change_player method.

Player(money)(name)(position)
